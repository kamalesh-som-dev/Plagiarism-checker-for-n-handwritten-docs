Following shill 2-PL ensures that our schedule is: serizibility, recoverable
&
Sol:
Thomas cascadeless. while rule control does not enforce conflid serializability.
In 2PL, transactions for do community not release exclusive locks until The transaction
Time has Schedule with Thomas write rub generate view 6 serial
commited or aborted ,i.e schodule is recoverable.
Schedule stap with ordering blind write because of blind write, it won't conflict

7) consider the schema with non- trivid F.D
(i) Registration (Rouno, consid, email)
(ii) Adlro, coussid email
(iii) email 10Hno.
Justify wrother schema is in 3NF & in BINF.
Sol:
Since { rollins, coursid is primary key so 1011 ro & consid all prime thibutes. email
is non- prim athlibute
FD
roll N, consoid email is in BCNF & 3NF but FD email rolho violates the
rule of BINF because email is not superkey But it satisfies rub of 3 NF because
rollno is prime athibate.
50, overall this relation is in 3NF but not in BCNF.

A database of research articles in a journel uses the following Schoo
(volume, Number, startpay, end pay, like, you, price , The primary key is (Udars,
Startpage, addage) & 120 following FD exist in the schema. (Volins, Number
standpage endpag ) Title (volume, number year ( volum, Number, stadpay, ending >se
The database is redesignal to we the following schemas. (Volume ,Number
endonge, title , hice ) (Volume, Number, year). which is the watest name form
that the new database satisfies ,but old on does not?
Sd:
Old relation has functional dependency : Volume, Number you as partial depending So
But ,there is no partial dependency in the Now relation & so it satisfies ONE
it does not follow aNF
as well as 3NF
Thaefor, aNF is the weakest normal form that to NW databas satisfies,
but old one does not

Consider following 2 please locking protocol Suppose a transaction T accesses
for read on write operations) a certain set of objects {01, 03. consider
the following 2PL protocol Suppose a transaction T accesses (for read /write
operations), a certain set of abjuts O. IX This is done in following maam
Step T acquires exclusive locks to 01 on in increasing order of his address
Step2: The reqd operations as performed.
Stop3: An books are released 4.
This is dono in following manner. car deadloch occur? does transaction
achieve serilizability.
Sul:
The above transaction scenario is consavative 2PL. In conservative 2PL protocol,
transaction has to loch all the items it access before the transaction begins
execution a . It is used to avoid deadlocks Also 2PL is conflid sevalizable,
therefore it guarantees serilizability.
