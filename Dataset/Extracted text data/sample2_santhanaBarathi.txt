Deadlock handling
Dead lock prevention may result in
unnecessary waiting and roll back. Furthermore,
certain deadlock -prevention techniques May
required more site to be involved in the
environment execution of a transaction than
would otherwise be the Case
If we allowed deadlocks to occur and
velay on deadlock detection, the Main problem
in a distributed system is deciding how to
maintain the wait for graph

Common techniques of doalings with this
issue require that each sit keep a local
wait - Br graph.
* The nodes of the graph correspond
to all the transactions that are
currently either holding or requesting any
of the items local to that site

depicts a system consisting of thosis
for maintaining its local wait for graph.
T2 and T3 appear in both graphs, indiating
that the transaction have requested item
at both sides

These local wait for graph are
constructed in the usual manner for
local transactions and da iteus
R when a transaction T, on site S, heads
a resource in site S2, it send S2, it sends
a request Message to site S2.,IF the
resource is held by transaction TJ. the
system insorts an edge Ti Tj in the
local wait for graph of site S2.

of since there is communication delay in

the cycle delation algorithm.
when the Coordinator invokes the deadlock

been selected as victim.

As an illustration I Considered a snapshot of
the system represented hy to local wait-for
grouph The T2 relogas the resource that it
is holding wh site S1, resulting in the deletion
of the edgo T, - Tz in S1.
t A dead lock has inded occured and
a victim has been picked, while one of the
transactions was aborted For reason unrelated
to the deadlack
*Both T2 and T3 are now rolled
back although only T2 needed to be
rolled back
He Dood lock detection Can be done in a
distributed manner with several sites
taking on parts of the task , instadd of
its being done at a siab site
R the however, such algorithms are more
complicated and more exepsive.

Parl A
For the two disk mirored case we assume A
disk and B DISK. It order to lose data, A
and B need to be failed at the same timo if
A is alleaded and with in 100,000 hours
B disk RS will fail, then datawill be last
The O ther case is B is alloady failed and
within 100,000 hours A will Fail and then data
will be lost
for the first call , 1 Disk is failed for
100 hours every 100,000 hours. So in order to
Male B to Fail if will weed 100,00012/

Mash tables May also be used as disk -

although B- trees ale more popular in these
applications. It Multi -nade databosesystems,
hosh tables are commonly used to distribute
rows amongst nades, reducing network happic
