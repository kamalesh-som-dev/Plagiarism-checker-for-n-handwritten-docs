(a) The Technology behind this functionality is Geographical
Data.
Geographical Data:
- They are spatial in nature
- Maps and satellite images are typical examples
-
Provides much more detailed information associated
with location such as elevation, soil type annual rainfall
Application of Geographic data:
They have variety of uses including online-map -
services; vehicle navigation systems ; distribution - network
information for public -service utilities such as telephone,
electric power and water supply systems ; and land -
usaye information for ecologists and planners
Web based road map services form a very
widely used application of map services data An
important benefit is that it is easy to scale maps
to desired size.
Road maps services also provides information like,
layout of road, speed limit, restrictions. with these
additional information, maps can be used for getting
directions from one place to another and automatic
trip planning. Users can query online information
about services to locate like hotels, gas, spa with
desired offerings and price ranges.
In recent years web based map services have
defined API'S that allow customers programmers to
create customised maps.
Vehicle Navigation systems are systems that
are mounted in automobiles and provide road maps
and trip-planning services. They include Global
Positioning system (GPS) unit, which uses information
broadcast from GPS satellites to find current location
with an accuracy of tens of meters. It finds location
in terms of latitude, longitude and elevation The
navigation system can query geographic database
to find where and on which road vehicle is located
Geographic database for public utility information
become very important They are categorised into
two types
1) Raster data
2) vector data
3
1) Raster data: consists of bitmaps or pixel maps in
two or more dimensions. A typical example of 2-d
raster image is satellite image of an area. It also
includes location of image with latitude, longitude,
resolution. Raster data is often represented as tiles,
each covering a fixed size area. It can also be
three - dimensional, with help of satellite.
2) vector data: constructed from basic geometric objects.
In context of geographic data, points are usually
represented by latitude and longttude Map data
are often represented in vector format. The vector
representation is more compact than the raster
representation in some applications.
Topological information, that is information about elevation
is represented in raster form The information can even
be converted to raster form before it is sent to
user interface post scripting languages. Map services
provide API'S that follow users to create specialised
map displays Map API'S for specific language are
buitt on top of a web service that provides underlying
map data

Dead Lock Handling
consider following two transactions
write (x)
T1: write(x)
T2 write (y)
writely)
X- lock on X
write (x)
lock on Y
write (y)
wait for X- lock on X
wait for X. lock on y
Result: Deadlock which cannot be detected locally
at either side.
Deadlock Detection:
In centralized deadlock - detection approach
a global wait for graph is constructed and
maintained in a single eite The dead lock coordinator
Real graph: Real, but unknown state of system
constructed graph: Approximation generated by
the controller during algorithm execution
The global wait for graph can be constructed
when
a new grouph 1 inserted removed
A number of changes have occurred in a local
wait for graph
co-ordinator needs to invoke cycle detection.
If coordin tor finds a cycle, it selects a victim
and notifies all sites The sites roll back transaction
Local and Global wait for Graphs:

1. T2 releases resources at SI
Resulting in message remove T,
T2 messaye from
transaction manger at S1.
2. The T2 requests resource by F3 at S2
Resulting in insert T2 T3 from S2.
suppose further insert message reaches before
the delete message
This can happen due to network delays.
The coordinator would then find a false cycle.
T1 T2 T3 T1
Distributed deadlocks:
Unnecessary rollbacks may result
when deadlock has indeed occurred and
victim has been picked and meanwhile one of
transactions have aborted
Due to global wait for graph false cycles.
However likelihood for false cycles is low.
In distribution deadlock-detection - sites
exchange wait -for information and check for
deadlocks

b)
challenges in maintaining Data consistency:
Data discrepancy occurs when data in target
database deviates from source database The extent
to which data deviates depends on various factors.
some Potential causes:
Migration Errors:
Different kinds of migration tools are employed
to facilitate the initial load of target database before
replication can begin
Lift and shift workload to cloud :
since world is moving towards cloud, the
lift and shift workload is the need of Today's
IT world.
Difference in source and Target:
Difference in data can cause subtle
discrepencies to happen during migration & replication.
Instantiation Errors :
Before migration or replication can begin, the
target databases will need to be instantiated
configura.ion
Improper and unintended configuration of
replication products can cause discrepencies
Replication Errors:
with asynchoronous replication, there will
be a short lay between base and delivery idatabase.
User Errors:
often target databases are treated to
offload query processing from source database.
REQUIREMENTS FOR MANAGING DATA CONSISTENCY :
High speed, low impact data compressions
support for Heteroyeneous database
support for handling large data volumes
Minimally intrusive
Data security
comparision of huge table through automated
and manual partioning
Early to use, understand , configure. deploy
and diagnise.

In 2 disk mirrored case, we assume disk A and disk B.
In order to loss data A and B have to bei failed at
same time If A is already failed then within
100,000 hours B will fail, then data will be lost and
vice -versa.
In first case A failed for 100 hours every 100,000 hrs.
so, in order to make B fail it will need 100,0002 /100 hrs.
In other case time is reduced to 100,0002/(2x100).

Database indexing : Hashing Table
Justification: Hash tables are commonly used to
distribute lows amongst modes, reducing network
trappic for hash joints.
Type of database is hashing table, Database indexing
3
Advantage:
1) computer based system provides enhanced data
retrieval techniques to retrieve data.
2) It is early to edit information in computers
to form files.
(10)
Disadvantages:
1) Data becomes Redundant in files
2) Because of Redundancy data inconsistency occurs.

MYSQL enables restrictions to be placed on reuse of
previous passwords. To establish password -reuse
policy globally. we use password history and
password reuse interval system variables.

SQL supports storing and querying of geospatial data,
that is, location data referenced to earth. Common
models of these data are planar and geodetic
co-ordinate systems Main distinction between these
two systems is latter takes curvature of Earth
SQL supports geometry and geography.
