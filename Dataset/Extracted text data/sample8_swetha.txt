DEADLOCK HANDLING:-
Deadlock prevention may result in
unnecessary waiting and rollback. If we allow
deadlocks to occur and rely on deadlock detection,
the main problem in a distributed system is
deciding how to maintain the wait -for graph.
consider the following two transactions
and history , with item X and transaction T, at
site 1 and item y and transaction T2 at site 2
T1 write (x)
T2:
write (x)
write (Y)
write (y)
X-lock on X
write (x)
X tock on Y
write (Y)
wait for X lock on X
wait for X -lock on y
Result:- Deadlock which cannot be detected
locally at either site.
DEADLOCK DETECTION:-
In the centralized deadlock- detection
approach, a global wait- for graph is
constructed and maintained in a single site;
the deadlock - detection co-ordinator.
Real graph:- Real, but unknown, state
of the system.
Constructed graph:- Approximation generated
by the controller during the
execution of its algorithm
The Global wait-for graph can be
constructed from:-
a new edge is inserted in or removed
from one of the local wait - for graphs
a number of changes have occured
in a local-wait -for graph.
the co - ordinator needs to invoke
cycle -detection
If the co-ordinator finds a cycle, it
selects a victim and notifies all sites The
sites roll back the victim transaction.

FALSE CYCLES:-
uppose that starting from the state shown
in figure:- :-
1. T2 releases resources at S,
resulting in a message remove T,
T2
message from the Transaction Manager at site
S, (to the co-oldinator)
2. And then T2 requests a resource
held by T3 at site S2.
resulting in a message insert T2 T3
from S2 to the co-ordinator
suppose further that the insert message
reaches before the delete message
this can happen due to network
delays
The co-ordinator would then find a false
cycle
T1
T2
T3
T.
The false cycle above never existed in
reality
False cycles cannot occur if two - phase
locking is used.

Distributed dead locks :-
Unnecessary roll backs may result
when deadlock has indeed occured
and a victim has been picked, and
meanwhile one of the transactions was
aborted for reasons unrelated to the
deadlock.
Due to false cycles in a global
wait-for graph; however likelihood of false
cycles is low.
In the distributed deadlock- detection
approach, sites exchange wait-for information
and check for deadlocks.

CHALLENGES IN MAINTAINING DATA CONSISTENCY:-
Data discrepancy occurs when the
data in the target database derivates from
the source database. The extent to which
the data depends on various factors, some of
which may be intended and others unintended
some of the potential causes for data discrepancy
are described below:-
Migration errors:-
Different kinds of migration tools are
employed to facilitate the initial load of the
target databases before replication can begin
Differences in configuration for handling
data by the migration tools and replication
products can result in data dispen discrepancies.
Lift and shift workload to cloud:-
Since, the world is moving towards.
clouds, the lift and shift of database workload
from on -premises to cloud is the need of today's
IT world. Orade golden gate helps moving
the work load, the data-consistency access on-
premises and cloud data centers and data
compliance assurance is the top challenge in
hybrid cloud scenario
Differences in source and Target :-
-
Differences in source and target data-
base configuation, for example ; different encodings,
locales, endianness or database versions can
cause subtle discrepancies to happen during
migration.
Instantiation errors :- -
Before migration or replication can begin,
the target databasee will need to be instantiate
with the correct schema and constraints
Fail urre to do will result in the
source and target being out of sync.
Configuration error :-
Improper and unintended configuration
of replication products cause discrepancies. in
This type of discrepancy doesn't show up the
replication logs, since from the replication
products perspective, it is performing as
configured. This may prevent Q A tests from
detecting the issues as well
5
User errors:-
Often target databases are created to
offload quary processing from the source
database. This enables rich operational
reporting without impacting the applications
on the source database.
The challenges are addressed by
"CAP theorem".
CAP THEOREM:-
We need to know the three properties
of a system :-
consistency
Availability
Partitions.
CAP theoren says that "you can have
atmost two of these three properties of
anysystem"
Very large systems will particition
at some point
choose any one of consistency or
availability
Traditional database choose consistency
Many web applications choose
availability.
Except for specific parts such as
Order processing
Latency is another factor.
Many applications choose to serve
potentially stable data to reduce latency

Forrent protecol enables de centralization
of its resources by making use of peer-to-
peer network.
A small torrent file is created to
represent a file or folder to be shared.
Users can download the required files
using a unique magnet link associated
to each file on torrent.
In order to learn the Internet location
of any peers which may be sharing pieces, named
the client connects to the trackers
in the torrent file, achaines a similar
result through the use of distributed
hash tables.
The technology to ensure fault-toleran tolerance
is Fault-tolerant services by Replicated
6
state machines
Key requirement: Make a service
fault tolerant
Example: Jorrent / lock manager, etc
state machines are a powerful
approach to creating such services.
A state machine :-
has a stored state and received inputs
makes state transitions on each input
and may output some results
Transitions and outputs must be
deterministic
A replicated state machine is a state machine
that is replicated on multiple nodes.
All replicas must get exactly the
same inputs.
Replicated log! state machine processess
only committed inputs!
E ven if some of the nodes fail, state
and output can be obtained from other nodes

uses of Replicated State machines :-
implement wide variety of services.
Replicated state machines can be used to
Inputs can specify operations with tic parameters
But operations must be determinis
Result of operation can be sent from
any replica
usually gets executed only when
log record is committed in replicated log
Usually sent from leader, which knows
which part of a log is committed
Example:- Fault - tolerant lock manager
state lock table
Operations: lock requests and lock releases
Output: grant or rollback requests on
deadlock

Centralized implementation is made
fault tolerant by simply running it on
a replicated state machine.

Advantages:-
1. Data Retreinal :-
Computer - based systems provide enhanced
data retrival techniques to retreive data
stored in files in easy and efficient way. -
2 Editing : :-
It is easy to edit any information
stored in computers in form of files.
special application programs or editing
software can be used for this purpose.
D isadvant ages:-
1. Data Redundancy:-
It is possible to that the same
information may be duplicated in different results files,
this leads to data redundancy which
in memory wastage.
2. Data Inconsistency :-
Because of data redundancy it
is possible that data may not be in
consistent state

for the two disk mirrored case, we
assume A disk and B disk In order to lose
data, A and B need to be failed at the
same time.
If A is already failed and within
1,00,000 hours, B disk will fail, then data
will be lost
The other case is B is already failed and
within 100,000 hours A will fail and then
data will be lost
for the first case, A disk is failed
for 100 hours every 100,000 hours, so in
order to make B to fail, it will need
1,00,000 2 hrs
100
Because the other case, the time is
reduced
to 1,00,000

quarying of grop. geospatial data, that is,
location data referrenced to the earth.
Common models of those data are the
planar and geodetic co-ordinate systems
The main distinction between these two
systems is that the latter takes int Q
account the currature of the earth
SQL server supports geometry and geography
which correspond to the planar and geodetic
models

Database Indexing:-
Hash tables also be used as disk -
based data structures may and database indices
although B-trees are more popular in these
applications.
In multi-node database systems, hash
tables are commonly used to distribute
rows amongst nodes, reducing networks
traffic for hash joins
