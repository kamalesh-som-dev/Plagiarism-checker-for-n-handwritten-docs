Deadlock prevention may result in ancessary waiting
and roll back
The main prestom in distributed system is deciding
how to maintain loat for -grapts
Common fachiques for dealing with this issue require
that each site keepa local wait-to graph
The nodes of graph Corresponds to all transactions that
currently either holding or requesting any of the items
local to the site.

Foult tolerant Services Using Replicated state beachives
a
key requestment is make a Service facebo falorant
state macheries are powerful approach to
creating such Services
A state macherie has a stored state and receive
stake inputs state transitions ou each input and may output
some results
Transitions and outpute must be detormeristic
A equicated state wachine is a state machine that
is reeplicated ou weelingle uodes.
All reepicas must get exactly same injies
Even in some of the nodes fail 1 state and output
can be obtained from other hodes

Challenges involved in answeing data Consistoncy
(b)
D Distributed Concernsure control:
When data is shared among Various site, in case it
data is updated or modified in one site it has to be
tonly then database is said to consistent
reflected in others.
So, this integrity of database is maintained datafiase by specifying
the synchronization of access to distributed techniques uses
to concurrency different looking to data.

Replication Control:
Data might be inconsistent if the whole database stock piled or a
percentage of it is copied and Copies are
at dissimilar sites
is
more than one copy of a database, the issue evening

Data might become in consistent be multiple
users request data at same time

* To avoid this we lese locking peretocols and dead
lock handling.
Transparent Management :

The major problem is when data located database in homerous
locations and number of users are used that
so, transparent management of data is important
